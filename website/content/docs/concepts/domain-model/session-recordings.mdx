# Session recordings

A session recording represents a directory structure of
files in an external object store that together are the
recording of a single [session][] between a [user][] and a [target][].

The lifecycle of a session recording does not affect the
lifecycle of any files stored in the external object store.

A session recording belongs to one and only one [storage bucket][].
It is deleted when the [storage bucket][] it belongs to is deleted.

A session recording is associated with the
[target][] that the recorded session was against.
However, the lifecycle of a session recording is not tied to
the lifecycle of the [target][] it is associated with.
If the [target][] a session recording is associated with is deleted,
the association to the [target][] is deleted, not the session recording itself.

The deletion of a session recording does not delete or modify
any files in the external object store that the session recording represents.

The session recording records all interactions taking place over
the session, including metadata about the [user][], [target][] and any
[hosts][], [host sets][], [host catalogs][] and [credentials][] used.

A session recording represents [connections][] as separate
entities within the recording. Within each recorded connection, there
may also be a recorded channel. This represents a single channel
within which the [user][] interacted with the [target][] in protocols that
multiplex user interactions over single connections. For example,
the SSH protocol multiplexes user interactions within a single
connection, so a user's interactions over SSH will be recorded
within a channel.

A session recording belongs to the scope of the [storage bucket][]
it is stored in. This can be either the global scope or an [organization][]
scope.
